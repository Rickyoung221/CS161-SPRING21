; If the first element is atom, then it is the shallowest node, take it as the first element of the input and recursive call the BFS on the rest. 
; Otherwise, if the first element is a list, we may want to check other subtree that if there is other shallower node. Move the element to the end of tree and append with the rest list. Then recursively call BFS function on them. Take the TREE as a queue.

; These functions implement a depth-first solver for the missionary-cannibal
; problem. In this problem, three missionaries and three cannibals are trying to
; go from the east side of a river to the west side. They have a single boat
; that can carry two people at a time from one side of the river to the
; other. There must be at least one person in the boat to cross the river. There
; can never be more cannibals on one side of the river than missionaries. If
; there are, the cannibals eat the missionaries.

; In this implementation, a state is represented by a single list
; (missionaries cannibals side). side represents which side the boat is
; currently on, and is T if it is on the east side and NIL if on the west
; side. missionaries and cannibals represent the number of missionaries and
; cannibals on the same side as the boat. Thus, the initial state for this
; problem is (3 3 T) (three missionaries, three cannibals, and the boat are all
; on the east side of the river) and the goal state is (3 3 NIL).

; The main entry point for this solver is the function MC-DFS, which is called
; with the initial state to search from and the path to this state. It returns
; the complete path from the initial state to the goal state: this path is a
; list of intermediate problem states. The first element of the path is the
; initial state and the last element is the goal state. Each intermediate state
; is the state that results from applying the appropriate operator to the
; preceding state. If there is no solution, MC-DFS returns NIL.

; To call MC-DFS to solve the original problem, one would call (MC-DFS '(3 3 T)
; NIL) -- however, it would be possible to call MC-DFS with a different initial
; state or with an initial path.

; Examples of calls to some of the helper functions can be found after the code.

; FINAL-STATE takes a single argument s, the current state, and returns T if it
; is the goal state (3 3 NIL) and NIL otherwise.

; NEXT-STATE returns the state that results from applying an operator to the
; current state. It takes three arguments: the current state (s), a number of
; missionaries to move (m), and a number of cannibals to move (c).

; and cannibals from the current side of the river to the other side of the
; river.
; 1. If applying this operator results in an invalid state (because there
; are more cannibals than missionaries on either side of the river, 
; 2. or because it would move more missionaries or cannibals than are on this side of the
; river) it returns NIL.

; itself a list); the return should look something like ((1 1 T)).
